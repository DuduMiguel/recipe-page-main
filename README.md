# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page

![Design preview for the Recipe page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

I built this recipe page challenge using semantic HTML and custom CSS.

The layout is fully responsive, adapting from mobile to desktop screens smoothly.

I used CSS clamp for fluid typography, flexbox for structure, and custom color variables for easy theme management.

This project helped me practice accessibility, consistent spacing, and responsive design techniques.
